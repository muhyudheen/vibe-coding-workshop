# Vibe Coding Workshop

Short description of the repository (keep existing content above this if you already have it).

## Demos

Vibe Royale — a small browser demo that drops 100 emoji “players” into a shrinking storm. Open `vibe-royale.html` in your browser to play. Press `R` to quickly restart the demo.

(If you already have a README with similar content, add the "Demos" section near the top below the project description.)
